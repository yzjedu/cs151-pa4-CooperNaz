The goal was to make a program that analyzed headlines from the Australian Broadcasting System. The assignment was meant 
to provide practice with files, lists, designing functions, and implementing functions. There were some difficulties when 
it came to opening the files and reading the information properly. Eventually, I got some results that I was satisfied 
with. It was difficult working on this assignment by myself because I wasn't able to consult anybody as easily.
